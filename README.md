# wordle
A project containing code related to the game Wordle

Ideas:
1) code to determine the best possible starting word
2) code to determine the most optimal guess given gray/yellow/green letters
3) an actual replecation of the game

Files:
1) words_alpha.txt >> text file that contains all words in the English dictionary
2) words_alpha_test.txt >> a smaller list of random words in the English dictionary for testing purposes
