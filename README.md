# wordle
A project containing code related to the game Wordle

Ideas:
1) code to determine the best possible starting word
2) code to determine the most optimal guess given gray/yellow/green letters
3) an actual replacation of the game

Programs:
1) Wordle.java >> a program that finds the most optimal Wordle solution given a particular word
2) DelineateFile.java >> a program that allowed me to take Wordle's word bank and use it in my programs. Not actually relevant for anything but I didn't want to lose it.

Text Files:
1) words_alpha.txt >> text file that contains all words in the English dictionary
2) words_alpha_test.txt >> a smaller list of random words in the English dictionary for testing purposes
3) words_wordle.txt >> a list of possible words that Wordle uses to pick from
