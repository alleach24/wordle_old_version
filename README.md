# wordle
A project containing code related to the game Wordle

Programs:
1) WordleOptimizer.java >> a program that finds the most optimal Wordle solution given a particular word. I.e., the computer is playing Wordle for a word you pick. 
2) WordleGame.java >> a class of Wordle games that has three properties; an answer to the game, a list of possible guess words, and a list of possible solution words
3) DelineateFile.java >> a program that allowed me to take Wordle's word bank and use it in my programs. Not actually relevant for anything but I didn't want to lose it.

Text Files:
1) words_alpha.txt >> text file that contains all words in the English dictionary
2) words_alpha_test.txt >> a smaller list of random words in the English dictionary for testing purposes
3) wordle_solutions.txt >> a list of possible solutions that Wordle uses
4) wordle_guesses.txt >> a list of valid guesses according to Wordle


Future things to do:
1) WordleOptimizer.java:
    - factor in letter placement when determining the optimal word
